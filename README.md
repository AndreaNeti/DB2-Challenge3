# DB2-Skyline-Challenge
Data Bases 2 Skyline Challenge - a.a. 2022-2023<br>
**Professor:** [Davide Martinenghi](https://martinenghi.faculty.polimi.it/)
## The challenge 
The skyline algorithms we saw in class are inherently quadratic in the size of the dataset, but can we achieve sub-quadratic complexity (i.e., an overall complexity that is less than O(NÂ²), where N is the dataset size)?
Just focus on the 2-dimensional case and either
1) Prove that no sub-quadratic algorithm can correctly compute the skyline in 2D, or
2) Code (in a language of your choice) a correct algorithm that computes the skyline in 2D with sub-quadratic complexity.

[Here](Challenge3.py) is my solution in O(NlogN) that granted me 2 out of 2 extra points
